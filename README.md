# Latte Bot

A little Discord bot powered by [aoi.js v6](https://aoi.js.org/), it is intended to be self-hosted and ran on small servers. As of now it only supports basic music commands, i'll eventually add more if i have enough motivation lol.

## Installation

To install Latte you can run this command inside the project directory:

```bash
  npm update
```

## Start the bot

You can start the bot by running this command inside the project directory:

Alternatively, you can use `nodemon` for development purposes.
